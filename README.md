# DCNN-Face-inversion

DCNN face inversion effect materials including:  
1. stimuli (faces & objects) used in this article  
2. model transfer learning & training codes  
3. activation extraction codes    

### in this study we used DNNBrain, a toolkit based on Python to transfer-learn the networks, input stimuli and get the output results, and retrieve the activation values of the network for different stimuli.
